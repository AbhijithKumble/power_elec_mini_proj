\subsection{Performance Parameters} 
    
    average value of the output (load) voltage, \(V_{dc}\)
    
    average value of the output (load) current, \(I_{dc}\)
    
    output dc power, 
    \(P_{dc} = V_{dc} I_{dc} \)
    
    root-mean-square (rms) value of the output voltage, \(V_{rms} \)
    
    rms value of the output current, \(I_{rms}\)
    
    output ac power \(P_{ac} = V_{rms} I_{rms} \)
    
    efficiency (or rectification ratio) of a rectifier \( \eta =  \frac{P_{dc}}{P_{ac}}\) 

It is the conversion efficiency which is a measure of the quality of the output waveform. For a pure dc output,the conversion efficiency would be unity.

The output voltage can be considered as composed of two components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dc value and 
    \item The ac component or ripple.
\end{itemize}

The effective (rms) value of the ac component of output voltage is

\begin{center}
    \(V_{ac} = \sqrt{V_{rms}^2 - V_{dc}^2}\)
\end{center}

The form factor, which is a measure of the shape of output voltage, is

\begin{center}
\(FF = \frac{V_{rms}}{V_{dc}} \)    
\end{center}

The ripple factor, which is a measure of the ripple content, is defined as

\begin{center}
    \(RF = \frac{V_{ac}}{V_{dc}}\)
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \(RF = \sqrt{FF^2 - 1}\)
\end{center}

\subsection{Half wave rectifier}

    The Ripple Factor, 
    
    \[V_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{2}\]
    \[V_{dc} = \frac{V_m}{\pi}\]
    \[RF = 1.21\]

\subsection{Half wave rectifier with RC filter}
    The Ripple Factor,

            \[V_{r(p-p)} \approx \frac{V_p}{fRC} \]
            \[V_{dc} \approx \{ 1- \frac{1}{2fRC}\} V_p\]

            \[RF = \frac{V_r(p-p)}{V_{dc}}\]

    Ripple factor is minimum at \( C = x \, \mu\text{F} \)

    
\subsection{Full wave rectifier}

    The Ripple Factor, 
    
    \[V_{rms} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}}\]
    \[V_{dc} = \frac{2V_m}{\pi}\]
    \[RF = 0.48\]

\subsection{Full wave rectifier with RC filter}
    The Ripple Factor,

            \[V_{r(p-p)} \approx \frac{V_p}{fRC} \]
            \[V_{dc} \approx \\( 1- \frac{1}{2fRC}\\) V_p\]

            \[RF = \frac{V_r(p-p)}{V_{dc}}\]
